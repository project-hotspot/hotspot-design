# HubSpot Mobile App Design Doc

The HubSpot Mobile app will probably be developed natively
to enable it to run power-efficiently on both IoS and Android devices.

We could do it location based, or, have the user set some times
when they are comfortable with us tracking their location.

It would be basically be google maps but like with like color
for how many people are in a location. The heatmap would be real-time.
